Simple program to calculate N number of the fibonacci sequence.
This will take a dynamic programming approach. Goal of O(n) runtime.
The c code is what I am aiming to do. It can only go out to ~90 numbers of the sequence, but that is ok for this exercise.
Asm version allows greater than the maximum a 64bit int can hold but displays garbage.
